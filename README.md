This is an in-depth dive on ***Skyscrapers***, a Sudoku-like variety of puzzles. I cover myriads of techniques, tricks and tips that I’ve picked up in my years of solving them.

If you haven’t heard of Skyscrapers before, you should give one a shot. Yep, I mean [right now<sup>↗</sup>](https://www.brainbashers.com/skyscrapers.asp)! – the easiest ones can be solved in no time, even with no prior experience. If you like problem-solving, there’s a good chance you’ll fall in love with Skyscrapers ;)

You have a grid of numbers representing the heights of ‘skyscrapers’. The numbers along the outside are clues, indicating how many skyscrapers you could ‘see’ if you were to look along that axis. Starting with an empty of partially filled grid, you have to complete the grid, Sudoku-style, while fulfilling all of the clues.

Skyscrapers are super fun, and can easily get very difficult very quickly! With fewer clues and larger grid sizes, they become a deliciously mind-bending challenge, requiring logic, thought and ingenuity to crack. For those of you who’ve seen [*Integrity*](https://github.com/Sup2point0/integrity), it’s near-isomorphic to the satisfaction from solving integrals.

That’s all from me here. For more, [go explore](https://sup2point0.github.io/skyscraping).
