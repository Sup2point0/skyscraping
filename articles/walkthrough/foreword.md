If this were a book, I suppose this would be the first (meaningful) thing you read as you open it.

No, wait – we’re missing the pre-book acknowledgement,[^acknowledgement] excuse me.

[^acknowledgement]: What are you even meant to call it? Acknowledgements are for the end, right?

> *To Chepin, for sparking my love of Skyscrapers.*

There we go.

This website is an archive of strategies, techniques, tricks and tips, rules of thumb, and everything else you could want on solving Skyscrapers. It’s a compendium of knowledge, an enchiridion of logic, a library of experience. It’s– ok I’ll stop. You get the idea.

Now this is more of a wiki than a book, so everything is fragmented rather than being part of one cohesive narrative. I didn’t write these pieces with any particular order in mind, and it’s pretty difficult to justify a suitable order. That being said, having one is still useful for those planning on reading the whole thing, so if that’s you, I’ve collected all the pages in a somewhat suitable order in [Walkthrough](https://sup2point0.github.io/skyscraping/walk).

I first came across *Skyscrapers* in late 2021, courtesy of the puzzles section of [*The Monkeyopolis Times*]() (a fan-made Bloons newspaper on reddit, which I ended up becoming a part of). It’s been a fair while since then, so I can’t recall what happened exactly; but one way or another, I ended up quite enjoying Skyscrapers, and so they’ve become an occasional hobby of mine.

I created this website because I really couldn’t find anything else like it online. Maybe it’s just because Skyscrapers are fairly niche, or searching “skyscrapers” just isn’t the same as searching “sudoku”,[^search] or a lot of the ‘high-level’ stuff you can’t really ‘teach’ – but it felt a little weird to me for [brainbashers.com<sup>↗</sup>](https://www.brainbashers.com) to have thousands of Skyscrapers puzzles, with no resource to unravel the intricacy behind their solutions and show others how they might reach them.

[^search]: Searching “towers” is even worse.

So, enjoy *Skyscraping*, and I hope I can teach you something new. If you’re reading this while the site is still under development (status: it is), I apologise for all the holes – I’m working on writing and adding all the pages!
