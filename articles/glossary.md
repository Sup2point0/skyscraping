## Closed

In contrast to an [Open](#open) Skyscrapers, a **closed** Skyscrapers has clues along every [lane](#lane), such that it’s ‘closed off’.

|     |  2  |  2  |  3  |  3  |  1  |     |

</div>

With the maximum number of clues available, these Skyscrapers tend to require more work than thought, and aren’t particularly fun.


## Couple

Pencil marks in 2 cells in a lane, which contain the same pair of digits.

## Lane

A general term for either a **row** or **column**; any line of digits in the puzzle grid.


## Open

In contrast to a [closed](#closed) Skyscrapers, an **open** Skyscrapers does not have clues along every lane, but only a select few. This leaves parts of the edges of the grid ‘open’.

<div class="puzzle">

| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
|     |     |  1  |     |  2  |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|  2  |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|  4  |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|  3  |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|     |     |  3  |     |  1  |     |     |

</div>

With fewer but impactful clues, these Skyscrapers are much more ‘directed’ and challenging.
