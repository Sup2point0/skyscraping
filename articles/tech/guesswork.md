A fundamental ground truth when solving Skyscrapers, or any kind of logic puzzle for that matter, is that you never guess. Every step in the solution is a logical deduction. As such, when you enter in a digit, you’re certain it’s correct. If you’re guessing a digit, you shouldn’t fill it in.

There is no “It’s most likely to be this” or “I feel like it’ll be” in Skyscrapers. There’s no chance or probability involved – it’s purely logic. You never *need* to guess, because there is always sufficient information to deduce the next step – you just haven’t found it yet!

> I’ve seen a few beginners do this, where they go with instinct and guess a digit. I can understand how this is a natural response, especially for those unacquainted with logic puzzles.

Of course, there is nothing stopping you from guessing, other than the total lack of satisfaction and fulfilment in doing so. We solve Skyscrapers to engage the mind, so resorting to guessing totally misses the point.
