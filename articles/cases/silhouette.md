When we have a clue of $1$, we know the tallest skyscraper $N$ must lie immediately in front of that clue.

Since we can only see 1 skyscraper, it has to be the tallest one blocking all the rest. If it were anything else, weâ€™d be able to see the tallest skyscraper behind it as well.

This is usually the first kind of deduction you make at the start of skyscrapers, when locating the $N$ skyscrapers.
