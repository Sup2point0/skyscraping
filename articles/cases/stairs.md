When we have a clue of $N$, we know that lane must be in order from $1$ to $N$.

<div class="puzzle">

| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|     |     |**5**|     |     |     |     |
|     |     |**4**|     |     |     |     |
|     |     |**3**|     |     |     |     |
|     |     |**2**|     |     |     |     |
|     |     |**1**|     |     |     |     |
|     |     |  5  |     |     |     |     |

</div>

Any other ordering, and we wouldn’t be able to see all $N$ skyscrapers – we’d have a taller one blocking a shorter one behind it.
